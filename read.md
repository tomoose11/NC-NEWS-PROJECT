# NC NEWS FRONT END

This is a news aggregator website in the style of 'Reddit'. It was built using facebook's create-react-app npm package. News articles can be voted on or disscussed. Articles and topics can be posted to the site, and you can sort articles by date, title, votes and more. React and Material UI used on the front end. Tested on the front end with Cypress. The site also has login in functionality, only allowing you to log in with one of the following usernames: jessjelly, weegembump, grumpy19.
